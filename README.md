# Daily dose of malware
DDOM or Daily Dose of Malware allows you to gather malware and c&c from open source intelligence.\
It can display info, export results to text file or download malicious software.\
I want to make it as fresh as possible, that's why all malwares are dated on few days back.\
Cymon displays last ten records, Google shows only first page and Malcode only main page.\
Malshare API is updated, if new sample appears.

Supported platforms:\
[Malcode](http://malc0de.com/)\
[Malshare](https://malshare.com/) (You need to get api key)\
Google dorks\
[Cymon](https://cymon.io/)\
-[Vx vault](http://vxvault.net/)\
-[CyberCrime tracker](http://cybercrime-tracker.net/)\
-CybeCrime tracker for Pony malware (mostly c2 servers)\
-Malcode

## IMPORTANT
1. **You are dealing with real malware, which may harm your computer badly. I'm not responsible for any caused damages. Be careful and think.**
2. For Google dorks please make sure to use newest firefox and geckodriver. It simulates browser, so it may not working sometimes because of google captcha. My advice is to connect and reconnect your vpn.
3. To use Malshare, you have to register and obtain api key. Then paste it to modules/malshare.py - line 21
4. If you know more public and open source platforms for retrieving malware, let me know.
5. **If this script violates terms of service from any used service, let me know and I will delete it.**
6. Not all of google dorks are perfect, you may encounter on some false positives.

## Licence
Do whatever you want to do with this tool.\
If you know how to develop or have any idea, let me know.
